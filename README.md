# Zillow Housing Market ReactD3 concept testing

This exercise demonstrates the use of D3 in conjunction with react. Because this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), you'll need to run `npm install` inside the project directory to install necessary packages. Then start your server by running `npm start`.

The site is live [here](https://housing-market.herokuapp.com/).

This project serves as an example for comparing react and d3 for the appending and control of svg nodes on to a visualization.

Both will grow side by side to experiment with what allows for more control over visualization.

The goal is to start simple but as the visualization gets more complex, I will begin to formulate what combination of the tools serves me best.

This project serves as the second segment in order to gain a better understanding and ultimately coding fluidity for creating advance interactive visualizations.
